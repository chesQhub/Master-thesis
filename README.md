Welcome to the Master's thesis repository of Francesc Montardit Tard√†, a master's candidate in Plant Breeding at the Mediterranean Agronomic Institute of Zaragoza, Spain. At this moment, this repository will be used as a way to share data, supplementary material, protocols and other material for a better comprehension of our research.

The title of this master's thesis is "Genomic delimitation of proximal promoter regions: Three approaches in *Prunus persica*". Supplementary data is provided here, along with some protocols and scripts.
