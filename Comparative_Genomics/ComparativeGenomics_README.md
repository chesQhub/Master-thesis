# Supplementary data of Comparative genomics

This folder contains several hyperlinks to see different created sets of three plants genomes in SynMap3D, a tool from Comparative Genomic's Platform (CoGe).

&nbsp;

In subfolders, "true" reliable syntenic orthologous genes (syntelog) per set are shown in tables. Please, take a look at the last column. A link is located here that can be used to visualize with Genome EVOlution Analysis tool (GEvo) each triplet of syntelogs.
